Sourav likes to do weird things. Recently he wrote out some numbers according to some logic in a file, and then deleted it. Unfortunately Sourav is also a terrorist! He was investigated by a top secret spy who managed to steal Sourav's laptop. 

This spy tried to decipher the secrets of Sourav's laptop and recovered deleted data from disk. He found the deleted file but some of its line were corrupted. Now there is a big hole in the file. This file might contain very important information about future terrorist attacks! Your mission, should you choose to claim it, is to restore the blank lines in *secret_file.txt*.

__Note__: To remove ambiguity, pattern is simple, easily explainable in 10-20 words.


Bonus Task: The *secret_file.txt* has been extended, fill any 5 blank lines (contiguous) for 10 points! __Do not disclose the pattern to anyone!!__
