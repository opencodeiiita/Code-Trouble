However he gets stuck on the problem and realises he would need to do a large number of calculations to solve the problem, so he turns to his coder friend Babita, who incidently has a crush on him and is eager to help him. Babita writes the code to solve question but has made a mistake somewhere. Now Babita turns to you for help, and gives you her code. You have a crush on Babitaji's sibling.
