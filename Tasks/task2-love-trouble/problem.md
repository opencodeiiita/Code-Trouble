Tillu has a crush on Omkar. She wants to get closer to him therefore she invited him to play badminton with her.  To make Omkar spend more time with her she comes up with a unique rule for their tournament. The winner of their tournament will be the person who wins a total of k matches first.

Tillu's friend Vishu is a maths nerd. He also has a crush on Tillu. He decides to impress him by telling him the total number of possible ways the tournament can go. However he gets stuck on the problem and realises he would need to do a large number of calculations to solve the problem, so he turns to his coder friend Babita, who incidently has a crush on him and is eager to help him. Babita writes the code to solve question but has made a mistake somewhere. Now Babita turns to you for help, and gives you her code. You have a crush on Babitaji's sibling. Help her debug the code and she might just set you up!

Note- since the number of ways can be a very large number, output it modulo 1000000007.
